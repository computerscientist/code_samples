******************************Gameplay*********************************
In this game, you are flying through a tunnel in deep space, and your goal is to collect as much treasure as possible. Navigate through the tunnel by listening to the sounds of the walls. If the wall sounds louder on the left side, you are closer to the left side. If the wall sounds louder on the right side, you are closer to the right side. If you hear a bang on one side, you have hit the tunnel wall on that side. You can hit the tunnel wall 10 times before dying. The tunnel gets narrower and narrower over time. Can you collect all the treasure before the tunnel closes in on you?

treasure you collect is worth 100 points

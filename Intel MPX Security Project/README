This project is a security verification of the new Intel MPX extensions
I did with Jun Jiang (also a UNC-Chapel Hill student) as a final
project for professor Cynthia Sturton's "Software Security"
course in the spring of 2014 at UNC-Chapel Hill. Since we did not
have access to a physical architecture with Intel MPX extensions,
we did our verification on an emulated version of such a system.
Our final results can be found in the "final_paper.pdf" file.

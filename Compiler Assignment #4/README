I did this project for my COMP 520 (Compilers) class in the Spring of this year. The mJAM code was not written by me, but was provided as a backdrop for testing the assembly code generated by my compiler. Also, the classes in the miniJava.AbstractSyntaxTrees package were provided to me by the instructor as a backdrop for implementing the Abstract Syntax Trees that the Compiler uses (I made a few changes to these classes, which are noted in the Compiler Guide). In addition, the "checkpoint" java files in the "tester" folder were written by the instructor in order to test my compiler. I have also provided a test file named pi.java (which calculates 221 digits of pi) for my compiler. Finally, in the "Further Reference" folder, the assignments that I did for this project can be found, and more info can be found in the Compiler Guide.

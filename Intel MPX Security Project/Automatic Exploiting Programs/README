The "exploit_simple_example" program is designed to test the "simple_example" program with ASLR turned on, while the "exploit_simple_example_from_top" program is designed to test the "simple_example" program with ASLR turned off (it keeps trying lower and lower addresses while trying to exploit the "simple_example" program)

While the shellcode in each of the two testing programs is hard-coded, feel free to change it if you need to test different pieces of shellcode against "simple_example" while exploiting it

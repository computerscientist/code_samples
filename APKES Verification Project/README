This is a project in which me and Rob Lewis (https://github.com/superdude264)
created an SPDL code representation of the high-level APKES protocol as discussed
in the "6LoWPAN Security: Adding Compromise Resilience to the 802.15.4 Security Sublayer"
paper by Krentz et al, and then plugged it into the Scyther tool for protocol verification
(http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/cas.cremers/scyther/). We only verified the APKES protocol
in our final paper, and so the LEAP protocol description (also discussed in the paper by
Krentz et al) in the "leap.spdl" file is incomplete and was not used in our final result.
Our results are discussed in the "Final Paper.pdf" file.
